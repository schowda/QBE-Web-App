# QBE-Web-App

In this project, we have developed a Web Application which allows user to access QBE (Query By Example). Using a Graphical User Interface, the user enters his MySQL Database Credentials to access the QBE Interface. QBE is a visual query language primarily developed at IBM. In this Project, we are not trying to build a full-fledged QBE, but a subset of that. This subset involves SPJ (Select Project Join) queries. We used Javascript on the frontend and GraphQL in Python Graphene was used on the backend.
